# Image Editor

The editor allows you to modify generated images without the need for third-party programs. It's a powerful tool for finalizing your generations.

## Opening the Editor

There are several ways to open an image in the editor:

1. **From generator gallery** — hover over an image and click "Edit"
2. **From main gallery** — open an image and select "Edit"
3. **Directly** — go to "Editor" in the navigation and upload an image

## Main Tools

### Crop

Crop the image to the desired size or aspect ratio. Available presets:
- Free crop
- 1:1 (square)
- 16:9 (widescreen)
- 9:16 (vertical)
- 4:3 (classic)

### Scale

Resize the image while maintaining proportions. Useful for preparing images for social media publication.

### Rotate

Rotate the image to any angle. Quick rotations at 90° and precise angle adjustment are available.

### Flip

Flip the image horizontally or vertically. Often used to fix composition.

## Filters and Effects

import { Callout } from '@/components/mdx'

### Available Adjustments

- **Brightness** — lighten or darken the image
- **Contrast** — strengthen or weaken the difference between light and dark areas
- **Saturation** — color intensity

- **Highlights** — detail in bright areas
- **Temperature** — warm or cool tones
- **Tint** — color shift

## Drawing and Masks

### Brush

Draw over the image with various brushes:
- Brush size adjustment
- Edge hardness adjustment
- Color selection
- Opacity adjustment

### Mask for Inpainting

Create masks for selective editing:

1. Select the "Mask" tool
2. Paint over the area you want to change
3. Click "Send to Generator"
4. Write a prompt for the new area
5. Start generation

<Callout type="warning">
For quality inpainting, it's recommended to paint the area with a small margin beyond the object you want to change.
</Callout>

## Text and Labels

Add text to images:
- Font selection
- Size adjustment
- Text and outline color selection
- Positioning

## Layers

The editor supports working with layers:
- Adding new layers
- Changing layer order
- Layer opacity adjustment
- Blending modes

## Saving and Export

After editing, you can:

- **Save to gallery** — the image will appear in your personal gallery
- **Download** — save to your device in PNG or JPEG format
- **Send to generator** — use as a base for new generation

### Export Formats

- **PNG** — lossless quality, transparency support
- **JPEG** — smaller file size, quality adjustment

## Integration with Generator

The edited image can be used as an Init Image for further generation. This allows you to create complex compositions iteratively:

1. Generate a base image
2. Edit it in the editor
3. Send back to the generator
4. Add new elements through inpainting
5. Repeat the process until you achieve the desired result

- **Ctrl+Y** — redo undone action
- **Ctrl+S** — save image
- **Space + drag** — pan across the image
- **Mouse wheel** — zoom
