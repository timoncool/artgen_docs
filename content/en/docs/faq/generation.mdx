# Generation FAQ

Common questions about the image generation process.

## How long does generation take?

Generation time depends on:
- Selected model
- Resolution
- Performance mode (Sketch/Draft/Masterpiece)
- Current server load

Typical times: 10-60 seconds.

## Why did my generation fail?

Possible reasons:
- Server overload (try again later)
- Invalid prompt content
- Technical issues

If errors persist, contact support.

## Can I generate the same image again?

Yes! Use the same seed value with identical settings to reproduce an image exactly.

## Why doesn't my image match the prompt?

Tips for better results:
- Be more specific in your description
- Use weights to emphasize important elements
- Try different models
- Adjust CFG (prompt adherence) setting

## How do I improve image quality?

- Use "Masterpiece" performance mode
- Increase resolution
- Use appropriate model for your style
- Add quality-related terms to prompt
- Use upscaling for final images

## What's the maximum resolution?

Maximum resolution depends on the model:
- SDXL models: up to 1536x1536
- SD 1.5 models: up to 768x768

Use upscaling for larger sizes.
