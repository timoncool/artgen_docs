# Prompt Tips

Practical recommendations for writing effective prompts.

## Follow the Structure

Recommended prompt structure for best results:

<Steps>
### Image Type
Photograph, drawing, 3D, illustration

### Subject
What or who is in the image

### Appearance
Details and characteristics of the subject

### Elements
Additional objects and details

### Location
Where the subject is located

### Effects
Lighting, atmosphere, mood

### Style
Artistic direction
</Steps>

## Be Specific

The more detailed the description, the more accurate the result:

<Tabs items={['Bad', 'Good']}>
  <Tab>
    `cat`
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    `photograph, fluffy orange cat, green eyes, lying on windowsill, sunlight from window, warm tones, cozy atmosphere`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use Weights Wisely

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Weights only work in parentheses `()`. Square brackets `[]` decrease weight.
</Callout>

**Rules for working with weights:**
- Start with small changes (1.1-1.2)
- Increase gradually in 0.1-0.2 increments
- Avoid extreme values (above 1.8)
- Weights that are too high can cause artifacts

**Examples:**
```
(vibrant:1.2) colors, ((detailed)) background
(red:1.4) hair, (blue eyes:0.8)
```

## Use Descriptive Adjectives

Add quality characteristics:
- Colors: vibrant, saturated, pastel, neon
- Lighting: soft, dramatic, contrasting, diffused
- Mood: cozy, gloomy, joyful, mysterious
- Textures: smooth, rough, glossy, matte

## Specify Style

Define the artistic direction:
- Photorealistic
- Digital painting
- Anime
- Oil painting
- Watercolor
- Cyberpunk
- Fantasy art

## Add Technical Details

For quality results, specify:
- Resolution: 4k, 8k, high quality
- Detail: detailed, sharp, crisp
- Render: octane render, unreal engine
- Camera: 85mm, portrait lens, wide angle

## Experiment

Don't be afraid to try different phrasings. Sometimes a small change in the prompt gives a completely different result.

## Study Others' Work

<Callout type="info">
Look at prompts from successful generations in the gallery and learn from them. This is a great way to understand which phrasings work best.
