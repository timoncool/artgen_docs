# Styles

![Styles](/screens/style-selection.png)

ArtGeneration.me features an extensive collection of **307 unique styles** gathered from around the world. Each style has its own characteristics and can dramatically change the generation result.

Styles are preset requests that are added to what you enter in the main text input. Styles are a convenient and quick way to try different concepts.

Use styles wisely — the more styles you use, the higher the chance of getting unclear results instead of quality generation.
