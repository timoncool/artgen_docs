# Generation Parameters

![Generation Parameters](/screens/generator-right-panel.png)

Technical parameters allow you to fine-tune the image generation process. Understanding these parameters will help you get higher quality and more predictable results.

## Seed

![Seed](/screens/seed-setting.png)

Seed is the initial value for the random number generator. This number determines the "randomness" of generation.

**How it works:**
- With the same seed value and all other parameters, you will get an identical image
- A random seed gives a unique result each time
- You can copy the seed value of a generation you like and use it to create variations
- Click the dice icon to generate a random value

**Applications:**
- Found a good composition? Lock the seed and experiment with the prompt
- Want a series of similar images? Use the same seed value with small prompt changes
- Need reproducibility? Save the seed value along with other parameters

## Number of Images

![Number of Images](/screens/num-images-selection.png)

You can generate from 1 to 4 images per request. This is convenient for quickly comparing options. The generation cost is shown next to each button.

## Private Mode

Enable "Private Mode" so your images are not displayed in the public gallery and are visible only to you.

## CFG Scale (Guidance Scale)

CFG Scale determines how strictly the model follows your prompt. This is one of the most important parameters for controlling the result.

**Values:**
- **1-4** — The model has great creative freedom, can significantly deviate from the prompt
- **5-7** — Balance between following the prompt and creative freedom. Recommended for most tasks
- **8-12** — The model strictly follows the prompt
- **13-20** — Very strict adherence. May lead to artifacts

**Recommendation:** Start with **7** and adjust based on results.

## Generation Steps

The number of steps determines how many iterations the model goes through when creating an image. More steps means more details, but also more time.

**Values:**
- **15-25** — Fast generation, basic quality
- **25-35** — Optimal balance of quality and speed
- **35-50** — High quality for final works

<Callout type="info">
After a certain number of steps, quality stops improving. For most models, this is 30-40 steps.
</Callout>

## Sampler

The sampler is an algorithm that determines how the model "moves" from noise to the final image.

**Popular samplers:**
- **Euler** — Fast and stable
- **Euler a** — More "lively" results
- **DPM++ 2M** — Excellent detail
- **DPM++ 2M Karras** — Improved version with smooth transitions

<Callout emoji="💡">
If you don't know which sampler to choose — use **DPM++ 2M Karras** or **Euler a**.

## Parameter Relationships

Parameters affect each other:
- High CFG Scale may require more steps
- Some samplers work better with a certain number of steps
- Different models have their own optimal settings
