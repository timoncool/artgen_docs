# Generation Parameters

![Generation Parameters](/screens/generator-right-panel.png)

Technical parameters allow you to fine-tune the image generation process. Understanding these parameters will help you get higher quality and more predictable results.

## Seed

![Seed](/screens/seed-setting.png)

Seed is the initial value for the random number generator. This number determines the "randomness" of generation.

**How it works:**
- With the same seed value and all other parameters, you will get an identical image
- A random seed gives a unique result each time
- You can copy the seed value of a generation you like and use it to create variations
- Click the dice icon to generate a random value
- **Green dice** means the seed will be random for each generation
- To lock a specific seed value, enter a number manually — the dice will turn gray

**Applications:**
- Found a good composition? Lock the seed and experiment with the prompt
- Want a series of similar images? Use the same seed value with small prompt changes
- Need reproducibility? Save the seed value along with other parameters

## Number of Images

![Number of Images](/screens/num-images-selection.png)

You can generate from 1 to 4 images per request. This is convenient for quickly comparing options. The generation cost is shown next to each button.

## Private Mode

![Private Mode](/screens/private-mode-toggle.png)

Private Mode hides your generations from all users — images will only be visible to you and won't appear in the public gallery.

**How it works:**
- **Closed eye** — private mode is enabled, generations are hidden
- **Open eye** — mode is disabled, generations are public
- Mode is **automatically enabled** when using "Your Image" (img2img) feature to protect your source images

<Callout type="info">
Private generations are not counted in gallery statistics and are inaccessible to other users even via direct link.

## Prompt Adherence (CFG Scale)

CFG Scale determines how strictly the model follows your prompt. This is one of the most important parameters for controlling the result.

**Values:**
- **1-4** — The model has great creative freedom, can significantly deviate from the prompt
- **5-7** — Balance between following the prompt and creative freedom
- **8-12** — The model strictly follows the prompt
- **Above 10** — Use only if you know exactly what you're doing. May lead to artifacts

**Recommendations by model type:**
- **Photorealistic models:** CFG **5**
- **Anime and 2.5D models:** CFG **7**

<Callout emoji="💡">
Start with the recommended value for your model type and adjust based on results. Too high CFG can lead to oversaturated colors and artifacts.
</Callout>

## Detail Level (Steps)

The number of steps (neural network passes) determines how many iterations the model goes through when creating an image. More steps means more details, but also more generation time.

**Values:**
- **15-25** — Fast generation, basic quality
- **25-30** — Optimal balance of quality and speed
- **30+** — Changes are barely noticeable for most models

<Callout type="info">
**Important:** Beyond 30 steps, quality improvements are barely noticeable, but generation time continues to increase. We recommend using 25-30 steps for optimal results.
</Callout>

## Sampler

The sampler is an algorithm that determines how the model "moves" from noise to the final image.

**Popular samplers:**
- **Euler** — Fast and stable
- **Euler a** — More "lively" results
- **DPM++ 2M** — Excellent detail
- **DPM++ 2M Karras** — Improved version with smooth transitions

<Callout emoji="💡">
If you don't know which sampler to choose — use **DPM++ 2M Karras** or **Euler a**.
</Callout>

## Grain

<Callout type="warning">
This parameter is available **only on GE models** (Genesis Engine).
</Callout>

Grain adds controlled noise to the image, which allows you to:
- Improve fine detail rendering
- Create a film photography effect
- Add texture and "liveliness" to the image

**Applications:**
- For photorealistic portraits — adds natural skin texture
- For landscapes — creates atmosphere and depth
- For vintage or film stylization — enhances the retro effect

## Parameter Relationships

Parameters affect each other:
- High CFG Scale may require more steps
- Some samplers work better with a certain number of steps
- Different models have their own optimal settings
