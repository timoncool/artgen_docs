# Performance Mode

![Performance Mode](/screens/creative-mode-options.png)

Performance mode (creativity) is a convenient way to quickly configure the balance between generation speed and result quality. Instead of manually adjusting multiple parameters, you can choose one of the preset modes.

## Available Modes

### Sketch

The fastest mode for testing ideas.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimum number of generation steps
- Fastest execution time
- Basic image quality
- Minimum generation usage

**When to use:**
- Quick prompt idea testing
- Finding the right composition
- Testing different styles
- Checking LoRA functionality

### Outline

Balanced mode for everyday work.

**Characteristics:**
- Medium number of steps
- Good image quality
- Moderate generation time
- Optimal generation usage

**When to use:**
- Most everyday tasks
- Creating social media content
- Working on image series
- When you need balance between quality and speed

### Masterpiece

Maximum quality for final work.

**Characteristics:**
- Maximum number of steps
- Highest quality and detail
- Increased generation time
- Higher generation usage

**When to use:**
- Final versions of work
- Images for printing
- Important projects
- When quality matters more than speed

## How Mode Affects Parameters

When selecting a mode, the following are automatically configured:

- **Number of steps (Steps)** - from minimum in "Sketch" to maximum in "Masterpiece"
- **CFG Scale** - optimized for the selected mode
- **Sampler** - the most suitable algorithm is chosen
- **Other technical parameters** - configured for best results

## Recommended Workflow

<Callout type="info">
This approach saves generations and time, allowing rapid iteration during the idea-finding phase.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Start with "Sketch"
Quickly test several prompt variations and find a good idea.

### Refine in "Outline"
When you find a suitable composition, switch to "Outline" to refine details.

### Finalize in "Masterpiece"
Create the final version at maximum quality with "Masterpiece" mode.
</Steps>

**Example workflow:**
1. Sketch: 5-10 quick generations to find the idea
2. Outline: 2-3 generations to refine details
3. Masterpiece: 1 final generation at maximum quality

## Manual Configuration

If the preset modes don't suit your task, you can always configure parameters manually. Performance mode is a convenient way to get started quickly, but not a limitation.
