# Resolution

![Resolution](/screens/resolution-slider.png)

Resolution determines the size of the generated image in pixels. Choosing the right resolution is important for obtaining a quality result.

## How to choose resolution

In ArtGeneration.me, a convenient slider is available for selecting resolution. You can:
- Choose from preset aspect ratios (1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9, 9:16)
- Manually set width and height using sliders
- See the current aspect ratio and size in pixels

## Aspect ratios

### Square (1:1)
Ideal for:
- Portraits
- Avatars and icons
- Social media images
- Symmetrical compositions

### Portrait (vertical)
Ratios **2:3**, **3:4**, **9:16** are suitable for:
- Full-length portraits
- Vertical posters
- Instagram stories
- Book covers

### Landscape (horizontal)
Ratios **3:2**, **4:3**, **16:9** are suitable for:
- Landscapes
- Desktop wallpapers
- Cinematic scenes
- Banners and headers

## Recommended resolutions

### For SDXL models
- **1024x1024** — optimal square
- **1152x896** — landscape
- **896x1152** — portrait
- **1216x832** — wide format
- **832x1216** — tall portrait
- **1536x1536** — maximum for detailed work

### For FLUX models
- **1024x1024** — base
- **1472x704** — wide format
- **704x1472** — tall portrait
- Supports resolutions up to 4K and above

## Impact of resolution on result

**Generation time:** The higher the resolution, the longer the generation.

**Detail quality:** High resolution allows for more details but requires more computational resources.

**Cost:** Generation at high resolution may cost more coins.

## Upscale as an alternative

Instead of generating at high resolution, it is recommended to:

<Steps>
### Generate the image
Generate an image at the optimal resolution for the model (1024x1024)

### Apply Upscale
Apply **Upscale x2** or **Upscale x4** to enlarge without quality loss
</Steps>

## Tips

- Start with the recommended resolution for your model
- For testing ideas, use a lower resolution
- For final work, use Upscale x2/x4
- Consider the final use of the image when choosing aspect ratio
- Some models support resolutions up to 1536x1536 and above — check the model information
