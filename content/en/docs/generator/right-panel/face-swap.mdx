# Face Swap

Face Swap allows replacing faces in generated images.

## How It Works

1. Upload a reference face photo
2. Generate an image with a person
3. The face will be replaced with the reference

## Requirements

- Clear face photo
- Good lighting
- Front-facing preferred

## Quality Tips

- Use high-resolution reference
- Ensure similar face angle
- Match lighting conditions

## Limitations

- Works best with single faces
- May require multiple attempts
- Some styles work better than others

## Privacy

Reference photos are not stored and are deleted after generation.
