# Face Swap

![Face Swap](/screens/face-swap-panel.png)

ArtGeneration.me offers a face replacement feature for images. This tool allows you to replace a face in any generation or uploaded image with another face of your choice. Face swap can be activated in several situations.

## When creating a new generation

In the right sidebar, find the "Face Swap" section and upload a photo with the face you want to use. After the image is generated, the system will automatically apply the replacement, and both the result with face swap and without will be displayed as usual.

## Photo requirements

For best results, use a photo that meets the following criteria:

- **Human face only** — the technology does not work with animals or fantasy creatures
- **Preferably head only** on a solid background
- **Neutral facial expression**
- **Open eyes**
- **Good even lighting** without strong shadows
- **Frontal angle** (like a passport photo, but in color)
- **Clear, non-blurry image**

<Callout type="warning">
Face swap technology only works with human faces. Attempts to replace faces of anthropomorphic animals, anime characters, monsters, or other creatures may display an error or produce poor-quality results.

## Usage recommendations
