# Restoration + Upscale

![Restoration + Upscale](/images/blog/img_013.png)

A combined function that merges face restoration and resolution upscaling.

## Advantages

Performs two operations at once:
1. Improves face quality
2. Upscales resolution by 2x

## When to Use

- Portrait photographs for printing
- Images with people in high resolution
- When you need both to improve faces and increase size

## Processing Order

1. First, faces are restored
2. Then the image is upscaled

This order ensures better quality than the reverse sequence.

## Cost

Uses more generations than each operation individually, but less than both operations sequentially.

## Result

You get an image:
- With improved faces
- In increased resolution
- While preserving overall quality
