# Restoration + Upscale

![Restoration + Upscale](/screens/image-actions-toolbar.png)

A combined function that merges face restoration and resolution upscaling.

## Advantages

Performs two operations at once:
1. Improves face quality
2. Increases resolution by 2 times

## When to Use

- Portrait photos for printing
- High-resolution images with people
- When you need both face improvement and size increase

## Processing Order

1. First, faces are restored
2. Then the image is upscaled

This order ensures better quality than the reverse sequence.

## Cost

Consumes more generations than each operation separately, but less than both operations sequentially.

## Result

You get an image:
- With improved faces
- In increased resolution
- With preserved overall quality
