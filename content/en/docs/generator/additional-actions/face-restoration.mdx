# Face Restoration

![Face Restoration](/screens/image-actions-toolbar.png)

The face restoration function repairs distorted faces in generated images.

## Purpose

<Callout type="info">
Face restoration is intended for **significantly damaged faces**, not for minor adjustments. Use this function when a face is severely distorted.
</Callout>

## Problem

AI generation sometimes creates faces with:
- Severe feature distortions
- Blurry or unclear details
- Asymmetry
- Noticeable artifacts

## Solution

Face restoration uses specialized algorithms to:
- Repair distorted facial features
- Improve clarity
- Restore natural proportions
- Eliminate artifacts

## How to Use

<Steps>
### Hover over an image with a face
Select an image with a damaged face.

### Click the "Face Restoration" button
The button will appear on the action toolbar.

### Wait for processing
AI analyzes and restores the faces.

### Get the repaired result
The image with restored faces is ready.
</Steps>

## When to Apply

- When faces are **significantly distorted**
- For serious problems with facial features
- When the face is nearly unrecognizable
- For severe artifacts on the face

## When NOT to Apply

<Callout type="warning">
**Do not use** face restoration for:
- Minor adjustments
- Small imperfections
- Stylized images (anime, art)
- When the face looks almost normal
</Callout>

## Limitations

- Works better on large faces
- May change some features
- Not intended for cosmetic improvements
