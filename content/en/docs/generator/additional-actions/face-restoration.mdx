The face restoration feature improves the quality of faces in generated images.

2. Click the "Face Restoration" button
3. Wait for processing
4. Get the improved result

## When to Apply

- Portrait images
- Group photos
- Any images with people
- When faces look unnatural

## Limitations

- May change some features
- Does not always improve stylized images (anime, art)
