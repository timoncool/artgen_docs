![Upscale 2x](/screens/image-actions-toolbar.png)

The upscale function allows you to increase image resolution by 2 times while preserving quality.

## How It Works

Upscale uses special AI algorithms for:
- Increasing image size
- Adding details
- Preserving sharpness
- Eliminating scaling artifacts

## Result

A 512x512 image becomes 1024x1024 with improved detail.

## When to Use

- For printing images
- For use as wallpapers
- For publishing in high resolution
- When maximum detail is needed

## Cost

Upscale consumes generations from your balance. The amount depends on the source image size.

## Limitations

- Maximum size after upscaling is limited
- Very small images may lose quality
- Some artifacts may be amplified when upscaling
