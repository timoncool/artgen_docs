# 2x Upscale

![Upscale 2x](/images/blog/img_013.png)

The upscale function allows you to increase the image resolution by 2 times while preserving quality.

## How It Works

Upscale uses special AI algorithms to:
- Increase the image size
- Add details
- Preserve sharpness
- Eliminate scaling artifacts

## Result

An image of 512x512 will become 1024x1024 with improved detail.

## When to Use

- For printing images
- For use as wallpapers
- For high-resolution publication
- When maximum detail is needed

## Cost

Upscale consumes generations from your balance. The amount depends on the size of the original image.

## Limitations

- Maximum size after upscaling is limited
- Very small images may lose quality
- Some artifacts may be amplified during upscaling
