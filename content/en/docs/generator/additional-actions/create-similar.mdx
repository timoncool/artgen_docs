# Create Similar

![Create Similar](/images/blog/img_013.png)

The "Create Similar" feature generates variations of an image with the same parameters but a different seed.

## How It Works

When you click the "Create Similar" button:

1. All parameters from the original generation are copied
2. A new seed is generated
3. A new generation is launched

## Result

You will get an image:
- With the same prompt
- With the same model and style
- With the same technical parameters
- But with a different random variation

## When to Use

- When the result is almost perfect, but you want to try other options
- For creating a series of similar images
- For finding a better interpretation of the prompt

## Tips

If you like the general direction, but not the specific result, use this function several times to find the perfect option.
