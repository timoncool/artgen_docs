# Outpainting

![Outpainting](/screens/outpainting-menu.png)

Outpainting allows you to expand an image beyond its current boundaries, adding new content in chosen directions.

## How It Works

The AI analyzes the existing image and generates a continuation:
- Preserves style and atmosphere
- Continues the composition
- Adds logical elements

## Extension Directions

You can expand the image in any direction:
- **Extend top** — add content above the image
- **Extend left** — expand to the left
- **Extend right** — expand to the right
- **Extend bottom** — add content below the image

## How to Use

<Steps>
### Hover over the image
Select the image to expand.

### Click the Outpainting button
A direction selection menu will open.

### Choose the direction
Specify which direction to expand the image.

### Modify the prompt (optional)
If needed, you can modify the prompt to specify the desired content for the expanded area.

### Get the result
AI will generate the image continuation.
</Steps>

## Expansion Limits

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Image quality degrades with each successive expansion.

- Maximum of **~4 expansions** possible for a single image
- **Recommended: no more than 2 expansions** to maintain good quality
- With more expansions, quality degrades significantly
</Callout>

## Use Cases

- Changing aspect ratio
- Adding space for text
- Expanding composition
- Creating panoramic images

## Tips

<Callout type="info">
- Start with small expansions
- Use prompt modification to control content
- Limit to 1-2 expansions for best quality
- Check consistency of added content
