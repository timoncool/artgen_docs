The "Own Image" feature allows you to use a generated or uploaded image as the basis for a new generation (img2img).

## How to Use

1. Hover over an image in the generation results
2. Click the "Own Image" button
3. The image will be added to the settings panel
4. Adjust the strength of the original image's influence
5. Enter a new prompt or modify the existing one
6. Run the generation

## Influence Strength

The "Influence Strength" parameter determines how similar the result will be to the original image:

- **0.1-0.3** — minimal changes, structure preservation
- **0.4-0.6** — moderate changes, balance between the original and the prompt
- **0.7-0.9** — significant changes, prompt dominates

## Use Cases

- Creating variations of a liked image
- Changing the style of an existing image
- Adding or removing elements
- Improving composition
