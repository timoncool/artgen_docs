# Quick Actions

![Quick Actions](/screens/image-actions-toolbar.png)

Quick actions are a set of frequently used functions available with one click. They speed up workflow and allow you to perform typical operations without navigating through menus.

## Location

The quick actions panel is located at the bottom of the generator's left panel. It's always visible and accessible regardless of the selected tab (History, Favorites, Folders).

## Main Actions

**Generate** — starts generation with current parameters. This is the main button for creating images. Equivalent to the Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut.

**New Generation** — clears all current parameters and starts from scratch. Useful when you want to start a completely new project without influence from previous settings.

**Repeat** — runs generation with the same parameters but a new seed. This creates a variation of the last image while keeping all settings.

**Random Prompt** — generates a random idea for a prompt. Useful for inspiration or when you don't know what to create.

## Additional Actions

**Upload Image** — opens a file selection dialog to upload an image. Used for img2img mode when you want to create a variation of an existing image.

**Clear Prompt** — removes text from the prompt field, leaving other settings unchanged.

**Reset Settings** — returns all parameters to their default values.
