# Folders

![Folders](/screens/history-panel.png)

The folder system allows you to organize your images by any criteria: projects, themes, styles, clients. This is especially useful when you have a large number of generations.

## Why Use Folders

**Project Organization** — create a separate folder for each project and keep all related generations together.

**Thematic Sorting** — group images by themes: portraits, landscapes, abstractions, etc.

**Workflow** — create folders "In Progress", "Needs Revision", "Done" to track status.

**Client Projects** — if you work with clients, create folders for each order.

## Creating a Folder

Navigate to the "Folders" tab on the left panel.

</Steps>

The folder is created and ready to use.

## Folder Structure

**Nested Folders** — create subfolders for more detailed organization. For example: "Project A" → "Concepts" → "Version 1".

**Hierarchy** — folders are displayed as a tree. Click the arrow next to a folder to expand or collapse nested folders.

## Managing Folders

**Renaming:**
- Double-click on the folder name
- Or right-click → "Rename"
- Enter the new name and press Enter

**Deleting:**
- Right-click on folder → "Delete"
- Confirm deletion
- Images from the folder are not deleted — they remain in history

**Moving:**
- Drag a folder into another folder to create nesting
- Or use the context menu

## Viewing Contents

Click on a folder to see all images inside. Images are displayed as a grid of thumbnails.

**Counter** — the number of images inside is displayed next to the folder name.

**Recursive View** — when viewing a folder, you can enable display of images from all nested folders.

  - Create folders in advance before starting a new project

  - Don't create too deep nesting (2-3 levels is enough)
  - Regularly sort new generations into folders
  - Delete empty and unused folders
