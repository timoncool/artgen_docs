# Basic Syntax

Learn the basic syntax for using weights in prompts.

## Weight Format

Use parentheses with a colon and number:

```
(element:weight)
```

## Weight Values

- **1.0** — standard weight (default)
- **1.1-1.5** — increased importance
- **0.5-0.9** — decreased importance
- **1.5+** — strong emphasis (use carefully)

## Examples

```
(red hair:1.3), (blue eyes:1.2), portrait
```

## Multiple Weights

You can use multiple weights in one prompt:

```
(sunset:1.4), (ocean:1.2), (clouds:0.8)
```
