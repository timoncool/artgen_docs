# Usage Features

Important features to consider when using weights.

## Weight Limits

- Minimum: 0.1
- Maximum: 2.0
- Values outside this range may cause artifacts

## Interaction Between Weights

Weights are relative to each other. If everything has high weight, the effect is neutralized.

## Nested Weights

You can nest weights for complex control:

```
((important element:1.2):1.1)
```

## Negative Weights

Weights below 1.0 reduce element influence but don't remove it completely. Use negative prompt for exclusion.

## Model Compatibility

Different models may respond to weights differently. Experiment to find optimal values.
