## Weight Syntax

Weights allow you to increase or decrease the influence of specific words in your prompt.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Weights only work in parentheses `()`, NOT in brackets `[]`!
</Callout>

### Increasing Weight

| Syntax | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `(word)` | x1.1 | Increase by 10% |
| `((word))` | x1.21 | Increase by 21% |
| `(((word)))` | x1.33 | Increase by 33% |
| `(word:1.5)` | x1.5 | Custom value 1.5 |

### Decreasing Weight

| Syntax | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `[word]` | /1.1 | Decrease by 10% |
| `(word:0.5)` | x0.5 | Decrease by half |
| `(word:0.25)` | x0.25 | Decrease by 4x |

### Literal Parentheses

If you need parentheses as part of the text, escape them:
```
\\(text in parentheses\\)
```

### Weight Usage Examples

```
(red:1.3) hair, blue eyes, ((smile))
```

In this example:
- "red" is boosted to 1.3
- "smile" is boosted twice (x1.21)

<Callout type="info">
**Recommendation:** Start with small adjustments (0.1-0.2). Use moderate weights - values that are too high can cause artifacts.
</Callout>

## Language

<Callout type="info">
You can write prompts in English or Russian. English often gives more accurate results as most models are trained on English data.
</Callout>

## Negative Prompt

The negative prompt is entered in the "Avoid" field and specifies what to avoid in the image:

```
blurry, low quality, deformed hands, extra limbs
```
