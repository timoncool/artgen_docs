### Fine-Tuning Section

Fine-tuning image parameters:

- **Brightness** — adjust overall image lightness
- **Contrast** — adjust difference between light and dark areas
- **HSV** — adjust Hue, Saturation, and Value
- **Blur** — add blur effect
- **Temperature** — color temperature correction (warm/cool tones)

## AI Tools

**Inpainting (redrawing)** — select an area on the image and describe what should appear in its place. AI will redraw the selected part while preserving the style and lighting of the rest of the image. Ideal for fixing defects, replacing elements, or adding new details.

**Outpainting (expansion)** — extend the image boundaries, and AI will fill in the missing parts. Useful when you need to change the aspect ratio or add space around an object.
