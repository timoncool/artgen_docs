The ArtGeneration.me image editor is a powerful tool for refining and enhancing generated images. It combines classic editing tools with artificial intelligence capabilities.

![Image Editor Interface](/guide/editor-02.png)

## Main Features

**Inpainting (redrawing)** — select an area on the image and describe what should appear in its place. AI will redraw the selected part while preserving the style and lighting of the rest of the image. Ideal for fixing defects, replacing elements, or adding new details.

**Outpainting (expansion)** — extend the image boundaries, and AI will fill in the missing parts. Useful when you need to change the aspect ratio or add space around an object.

**Object Removal** — select an unwanted element, and AI will automatically remove it, filling the area with appropriate background.

**Retouching and Correction** — classic tools for fine-tuning: brightness, contrast, saturation, color balance.

**Working with Layers** — combine multiple images, add elements, create complex compositions.
