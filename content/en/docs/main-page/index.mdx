# ArtGeneration.me Main Page

## Navigation Bar

At the very top of the screen, you will see the navigation bar wherever you are. You can return to the main page at any time by clicking on the [ArtGeneration.me](https://artgeneration.me) logo.

- **Explore** — This is the main section from which you can navigate to any other. Here you will find the main gallery with search and categories, as well as the image gallery.
- **Create** — In the "Create" section, you can generate your own image. We will discuss this in more detail below.
- **Get Inspired** — This section features the best works from the community. Don't forget to like and add to favorites the works that you enjoyed and inspired you — this is how they get to the site's cover and the "Get Inspired" section.

## Getting Generations

Every day you have access to *300 generations with a PRO subscription and 50 generations without a subscription*. But to use the generations, you need to claim them. Simply click the "Claim" button and confirm the action.

Click "Claim" and the generations will be added to your balance. Generations don't expire, but you cannot accumulate more than the limit (300 or 50).

After claiming the generations, the button will change to a timer. Once it ends, you can claim generations again.

### Generation Counter

![Generation Counter](/screens/user-stats.png)

*White color* displays your daily generations. *Green* displays non-expiring generations that you received as a gift upon registration or can purchase on the payment page.

Non-expiring generations are very useful if you need to generate more than the daily limit at once. They are only used after daily generations run out.

<Callout type="info">
  Non-expiring generations are a great way to stock up on resources for large projects. They have no expiration date and are only consumed after daily generations.

### Payment Window

At the top of the window, there is a field for a promo code and payment method selection. The main interface is divided into three tabs, each offering different options for using the service:

**One-time payment** allows you to get access to the service for a selected period without automatic renewal. This option is suitable for those who want full control over their payments or plan to use the service for a short time.

**Subscriptions** offer automatic renewal and a permanent 20% discount. When choosing a long subscription period, additional discounts are available:

- A 3-month subscription gives an additional 10% discount, allowing you to save significantly with quarterly payment
- A semi-annual subscription increases the discount to 15%, making the service even more cost-effective
- An annual subscription provides the maximum 20% discount, which is especially beneficial for regular users

In the "**Generation Packs**" tab, you can purchase additional generations. These generations never expire and are only consumed after your free daily generations run out. Packs of 500, 2,500, and 8,000 generations are available — choose the one that best suits your needs.

With an active subscription, the bottom of the window displays information about auto-renewal status and the next payment date.
