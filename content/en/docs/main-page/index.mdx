# ArtGeneration.me Main Page

## Navigation Bar

At the very top of the screen, you will see the navigation bar wherever you are. You can return to the main page at any time by clicking on the [ArtGeneration.me](https://artgeneration.me) logo.

The navigation menu has three main sections:

- **Explore** — This is the main section from which you can navigate to any other. Here you will find the main gallery with search and categories, as well as the image gallery.
- **Create** — In the "Create" section, you can generate your own image. We will discuss this in more detail below.
- **Inspire** — This section features the best works from the community. Don't forget to like and add to favorites the works that you enjoyed and inspired you — this is how they get to the site's cover and the "Inspire" section.

## Welcome Bonus

<Callout type="info">
  New users receive a welcome bonus: 3 days of PRO subscription and 100 non-expiring generations!
</Callout>

## Getting Generations

Every day you have access to generations depending on your status:

- **MAX subscription**: 600 generations per day + 182 models + up to 8 images at once
- **PRO subscription**: 300 generations per day + 154 models + up to 4 images at once
- **Without subscription**: 50 generations per day

To use the generations, you need to claim them. Simply click the "Claim" button and confirm the action.

Click "Claim" and the generations will be added to your balance. Generations don't expire, but you cannot accumulate more than the limit (300 or 50).

After claiming the generations, the button will change to a timer. Once it ends, you can claim generations again.

### Generation Counter

![Generation Counter](/screens/user-stats.png)

*White color* displays your daily generations. *Green* displays non-expiring generations that you received as a gift upon registration or can purchase on the payment page.

Non-expiring generations are very useful if you need to generate more than the daily limit at once. They are only used after daily generations run out.

<Callout type="info">
  Non-expiring generations are a great way to stock up on resources for large projects. They have no expiration date and are only consumed after daily generations.
