# Generation Counter

![Generation Counter](/screens/user-stats.png)

The generation counter displays the number of available generations and helps track your balance.

<Callout type="info">
  The counter is always visible at the top of the screen, allowing you to quickly check your remaining generations.
</Callout>

## Location

The counter is located at the top of the interface and is always available for viewing.

## Counter Information

- **Current balance** — number of available generations
- **Generation type** — daily or non-expiring
- **Subscription status** — whether PRO subscription is active

## Color Coding

The counter uses color coding to distinguish generation types:

- **White color** — daily generations. This is your standard daily limit:
  - 50 without subscription
  - 300 with PRO subscription
  - 600 with MAX subscription
- **Green color** — non-expiring generations. Bonus or purchased generations that have no expiration date.

<Callout emoji="💡">
Non-expiring generations are only used after daily generations run out. This allows you to save bonus generations for larger projects.
</Callout>

## Balance Updates

The balance updates automatically:

- After each generation
- At the beginning of a new day (for daily generations)
- After purchasing additional generations
