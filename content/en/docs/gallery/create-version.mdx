# Create Your Version

![Create Your Version](/images/blog/img_026.png)

The "Create your version" feature is a powerful tool for learning and creativity. It allows you to use a liked image as a starting point for your own experiments.

## How to Use the Feature

1. **Find an interesting image** - browse the gallery and find a work that inspires you.

2. **Open the view** - click on the image to go to detailed view.

3. **Click "Create your version"** - the button is located in the action panel next to the image.

4. **Go to the generator** - you will be automatically redirected to the generator with filled parameters.

5. **Make changes** - modify the prompt, change the model, style, or other parameters as you wish.

6. **Start generation** - create your unique version.

## What Is Copied Automatically

**Prompt** - the full text prompt of the original image. You can change it partially or completely.

**Negative prompt** - exclusions used by the author. This is often an important part of successful generation.

**Model** - if the model is available in ArtGeneration.me, it will be selected automatically.

**Style** - the applied artistic style, if one was used.

**Technical parameters** - resolution, CFG Scale, number of steps, and other settings.

**Seed** - the initial generation value. You can keep it to get a similar result or change it to create a variation.

## Ideas for Experiments

**Changing the prompt** - add or remove elements from the description. For example, change the time of day, add a character, or change the mood.

**Switching models** - try the same prompt with a different model. Results can vary significantly.

**Style experiments** - apply a different artistic style to the same prompt.

**Seed variations** - change the seed while keeping other parameters. This will give a similar but unique image.

**CFG Scale adjustment** - increase or decrease the value to get more or less precise prompt following.

## Ethics of Use

**Respect authors** - the feature is intended for learning and inspiration, not for copying others' works.

**Create unique content** - make significant changes so your work is original.

**Learn from examples** - analyze why certain prompts and settings give good results.

**Share knowledge** - if you created an interesting variation, share it with the community.

## Limitations

Some parameters may be unavailable for copying:
- If the author hid the prompt or parameters
- If the model or LoRA used is unavailable
- If the image was created using deprecated features
