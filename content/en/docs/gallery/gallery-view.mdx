![Gallery View](/images/blog/img_027.png)

The ArtGeneration.me gallery displays images in an adaptive grid, optimized for convenient viewing on any device.

## Gallery Interface

The main gallery page consists of several elements:

**Navigation panel** - at the top are categories and filters for quick access to the desired sections.

**Search bar** - allows searching for images by keywords, prompts, or authors.

**Image grid** - the main area with image cards organized in an adaptive grid.

**Side panel** - on desktop, a panel with additional filters and categories may be displayed.

## Display Modes

**Grid** - compact display of many images. Optimal for quick browsing and finding inspiration.

**Masonry** - images are displayed while preserving original proportions, creating a dynamic layout.

## Gallery Navigation

**Infinite scroll** - when scrolling down, new images are automatically loaded. This allows continuous content viewing without page switching.

**Quick return to top** - a button in the lower right corner allows instant return to the beginning of the gallery.

**Keyboard navigation** - use arrows to move between images in viewing mode.

## Responsiveness

The gallery automatically adapts to screen size:

**Desktop (1920px+)** - 5-6 columns, maximum number of images on screen.

**Laptop (1200-1920px)** - 4-5 columns, comfortable viewing on medium screens.

**Tablet (768-1200px)** - 3-4 columns, optimized for touch control.

**Mobile (up to 768px)** - 2 columns, convenient one-handed viewing.

## Image Loading

Images load gradually using lazy loading. This ensures fast initial page load and saves bandwidth.

Image previews are optimized for fast loading, and full-size versions are loaded only when opening detailed view.

## Caching

Viewed images are cached in the browser, which speeds up repeated viewing and reduces network load.
