# Image Generator

The Generator is the main tool of the platform for creating images using artificial intelligence.

## Main Parameters

### Prompt
A text description of the desired image. The more detailed the description, the more accurate the result.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning">
Write prompts in English for best results. Most models are trained on English data.
</Callout>

### Negative Prompt
A description of what should NOT be in the image. Helps avoid unwanted elements.

### Model
The choice of generation model affects the style and quality of the result. Various models are available for different tasks.

### Style
Additional style modifiers that are applied to the generation.

## Advanced Settings

### Resolution
Choose the output image size. Various aspect ratios are available.

### Performance Mode
- **Sketch** — fast generation, low quality
- **Draft** — balance of speed and quality
- **Masterpiece** — maximum quality, longer generation

### LoRA
Low-Rank Adaptation models for fine-tuning the generation style.

### Seed
Generation seed. The same seed with the same parameters will give a similar result.

## Special Features

### Init Image (img2img)
Upload an image as a base for generation. Useful for:
- Stylizing photos
- Creating variations
- Adding elements

### Face Swap
Replacing a face in a generated image. Requires PRO or MAX subscription.

### Upscale
Increasing the resolution of a finished image while maintaining quality.

### Background Remove
Removing the background from an image.

## Prompt Tips

### Structure of a Good Prompt
1. **Main subject** — what is depicted
2. **Details** — features of the subject
3. **Environment** — background, setting
4. **Style** — artistic direction
5. **Quality** — technical parameters

### Example
```
a beautiful woman with long red hair, wearing a white dress, 
standing in a flower garden, soft sunlight, 
oil painting style, highly detailed, 8k resolution
```
