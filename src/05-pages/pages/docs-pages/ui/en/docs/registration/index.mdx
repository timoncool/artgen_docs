# Welcome & Registration

Welcome to the amazing world of digital creativity at [ArtGeneration.me](https://artgeneration.me), where anyone can become an artist with the help of artificial intelligence. To begin your journey, you need to create a personal account. This will allow you to fully immerse yourself in the creative process and use all the platform's tools.

On the main page, you'll find the "Start Creating" button - your first step towards creating unique images. When viewing any image in the gallery, you can also start creating your own version by clicking "Create Your Version". These actions will direct you to registration.

## Registration Process

Registration is a quick and simple process. You can choose quick authorization via **VK** or **Yandex**, which will allow you to use your existing credentials and simplify the login procedure.

If the automated system suspects you might be a bot, you may need to solve a captcha.

If you forgot your password, use the recovery function by clicking "Forgot Password?".

## Why Register?

Creating an account gives you the opportunity to:

- Save your work
- Receive updates
- Participate in the community
- Enjoy a personalized experience on the platform

You'll also be able to use social features:

- Subscribe to other users
- Follow their updates
- Track your payment and bonus history

  If you need help or have questions during registration, our support team **support@artgeneration.me** is always at your service.
