# Right Panel

The right panel of the generator is the control center for all image generation parameters in ArtGeneration.me. Here you select the model, style, configure technical parameters, and use additional features.

## Panel Structure

The right panel is organized into logical sections, each responsible for a specific aspect of generation:

**Model and Style Selection** — the foundation of any generation. The model determines the "character" of the image, while the style adds an artistic direction.

**Prompt Field** — this is where you describe what you want to get. A prompt is a text description of the desired image.

**Additional Features** — LoRA, source image, Face Swap, and other tools for extended control.

**Technical Parameters** — resolution, number of steps, CFG Scale, and other settings for fine-tuning the result.

## Main Sections

### Models
Choosing an AI model is the most important generation parameter. Different models specialize in different styles: photorealism, anime, 3D, illustrations, and others.

### Styles
A collection of 307 unique styles that add an artistic direction to your prompt. You can combine up to 3 styles simultaneously.

### LoRA
Additional models for specific effects, characters, or styles. LoRA allows you to achieve results that are not possible with base models.

### Source Image (img2img)
Upload your image as a base for generation. Includes cropping, sketch drawing, and inpainting features.

### Face Swap
Face replacement in an image. Works with both generations and uploaded photos.

### Generation Parameters
Technical settings: Seed, CFG Scale, number of steps, sampler. For fine-tuning the result.

### Negative Prompt
Specify what to avoid during generation. Helps exclude unwanted elements and artifacts.

### Resolution
Choose the image size. Different models are optimized for different resolutions.

### Performance Mode
Balance between generation speed and quality.

## Panel Controls

### Collapsing
The panel can be collapsed by clicking the arrow at the top. This increases the viewing area for results and is convenient when working with generation history.

### Scrolling
Use vertical scrolling to access all sections. On mobile devices, the panel adapts to the screen size.

### Hotkeys
Some actions are available via hotkeys to speed up your workflow.

## Workflow

Typical workflow with the right panel:

<Steps>
### Select a Model
Determine the base generation style

### Add Styles
Refine the artistic direction

### Write a Prompt
Describe the desired image

### Configure Parameters
If necessary, change resolution and other settings

### Start Generation
Click the "Generate" button
</Steps>
