# Left Panel

The generator's left panel displays all your created images and provides tools for working with them.

## Main Features

**Chronological Order** — all your created images are displayed in chronological order.

**Search by Prompt** — the search function allows you to find images by prompt text.

**Likes and Favorites Counters** — each image displays the number of likes and favorites.

## Reset Button (green)

At the top of the left panel, there is a **green reset button**. It allows you to quickly reset all current generator settings to defaults:

- Clears the prompt field
- Resets the selected model to default
- Disables all LoRAs
- Resets parameters (CFG, Steps, Seed, etc.)
- Removes the init image

<Callout emoji="💡">
Use the reset button when you want to start generation "from scratch" without the influence of previous settings.
</Callout>
