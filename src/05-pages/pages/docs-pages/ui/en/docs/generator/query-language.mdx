# Prompt Writing

A prompt is a text description of the image you want to create. The quality of your prompt directly affects the generation result.

## Recommended Prompt Structure

For best results, follow this structure:

<Steps>
### Image Type
Photograph, illustration, 3D render, painting.

### Subject
What is depicted: person, animal, landscape, object.

### Appearance
Object details: color, size, material, texture.

### Scene Elements
Additional objects and environmental details.

### Location
Where the action takes place: studio, street, nature, interior.

### Effects
Lighting, atmosphere, weather, time of day.

### Style
Artistic direction: realism, anime, cyberpunk.
</Steps>

### Prompt Examples

**Simple prompt:**
```
beautiful sunset over the ocean
```

**Detailed prompt following structure:**
```
photograph, young woman, long red hair, green dress,
bouquet of flowers, city park, soft evening light,
golden hour, portrait photography
```

## Weight Syntax

Weights allow you to increase or decrease the influence of specific words in your prompt.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Weights only work in parentheses `()`, NOT in brackets `[]`!
</Callout>

### Increasing Weight

| Syntax | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `(word)` | x1.1 | Increase by 10% |
| `((word))` | x1.21 | Increase by 21% |
| `(((word)))` | x1.33 | Increase by 33% |
| `(word:1.5)` | x1.5 | Custom value 1.5 |

### Decreasing Weight

| Syntax | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `[word]` | /1.1 | Decrease by 10% |
| `(word:0.5)` | x0.5 | Decrease by half |
| `(word:0.25)` | x0.25 | Decrease by 4x |

### Literal Parentheses

If you need parentheses as part of the text, escape them:
```
\\(text in parentheses\\)
```

### Weight Usage Examples

```
(red:1.3) hair, blue eyes, ((smile))
```

In this example:
- "red" is boosted to 1.3
- "smile" is boosted twice (x1.21)

<Callout type="info">
**Recommendation:** Start with small adjustments (0.1-0.2). Use moderate weights - values that are too high can cause artifacts.
</Callout>

### Visual Weight Examples

Below are examples showing how weights affect generation results:

![Weights example 1](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-1.png)
*Basic example: comparison of generation without weights and with boosted main subject weight*

![Weights example 2](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-2.png)
*Weight influence on color: boosting `(red:1.5)` makes the color more saturated*

![Weights example 3](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-3.png)
*Combining weights: simultaneously boosting multiple elements `((hair))` and `(eyes:1.3)`*

![Weights example 4](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-4.png)
*Decreasing weight: using `(background:0.5)` to reduce background detail*

![Weights example 5](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-5.png)
*Extreme values: effect of too high weight `(object:2.0)` and possible artifacts*

![Weights example 6](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-6.png)
*Fine-tuning: using fractional values `(element:0.7)` for subtle control*

![Weights example 7](/assets/docs-pages/guide/weights-example-7.png)
*Multiple weights: combining several weights in one prompt for complex effects*

## Language

<Callout type="info">
You can write prompts in English or Russian. English often gives more accurate results as most models are trained on English data.
</Callout>

## Negative Prompt

The negative prompt is entered in the "Avoid" field and specifies what to avoid in the image:

```
blurry, low quality, deformed hands, extra limbs
```
