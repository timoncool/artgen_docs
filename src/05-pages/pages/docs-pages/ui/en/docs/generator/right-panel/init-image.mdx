# Custom Image (img2img)

![Custom Image](/assets/docs-pages/screens/own-image-panel.png)

"Custom Image" allows you to use any image as a basis for generation. You can upload an existing image, draw a sketch, or use a mask for partial regeneration.

<Callout type="info">
All generations from "Custom Image" are set to "Private Mode" by default, so you don't accidentally share something you didn't intend to.
</Callout>

## Ways to Add an Image

### Upload Image

Upload an existing image from your device:

- **Formats:** webp, jpg, png
- **Maximum size:** 5 MB
- Images created in ArtGeneration.me are also suitable

After uploading, the system will offer to crop the image to match the selected resolution.

### Sketch

Draw an image directly on the canvas:

- Drawing on an empty canvas
- Customizable brush size
- Color selection
- Eraser for corrections

Sketch is ideal for creating a basic composition that the neural network will transform into a detailed image.

### Mask (Inpainting)

Paint over areas on an existing image to regenerate them:

- Paint over the areas you want to change
- Customizable brush size
- Mask inversion available (regenerate everything except the selected area)

## Cropping

If the image size and selected resolution differ, the system will offer to crop the image. You can set the desired size by changing the "Resolution" slider.

You can also:
- Move the image to set the ideal position
- Scale the image to zoom in or out
- Save the cropping result

## Degree of Change

![Degree of change slider](/assets/docs-pages/images/blog/img_011.png)

The "Degree of Change" slider determines how much the neural network can deviate from the original image. Values from **0** to **1**:

- **0** - the image will remain unchanged
- **Low values (0.1-0.3)** - minimal changes, close to the original
- **Medium values (0.4-0.6)** - moderate changes, balance between original and creativity
- **High values (0.7-0.9)** - significant changes, more creative freedom
- **1** - completely new image

<Callout type="info">
Start experimenting with a value of **0.5-0.6**. This is usually enough to see noticeable changes while preserving the main composition.
</Callout>

## Mask Generation (Inpainting)

![Drawing mask](/assets/docs-pages/screens/mask-paint-tool.png)

<Steps>
### Upload an image
Upload the image you want to partially modify

### Open the mask editor
Click "Draw Mask" to open the mask drawing dialog

### Paint over areas to change
Paint over the part of the image you want to regenerate

### Use inversion if needed
Mask inversion allows you to regenerate everything except the selected area

### Save and generate
Save the mask and start generation
</Steps>

![Mask panel](/assets/docs-pages/screens/mask-options-panel.png)

In mask drawing mode, the following options are available:
- Brush size selection
- Undo last action
- Mask inversion
- Delete mask
- Save mask

After applying the mask, you have access to:
- **Draw mask** - edit the mask
- **Delete mask** - clear the mask
- **Remove background** - automatically select the foreground object
- Degree of change settings

This technique is invaluable for:
- Improving faces, eyes, hands, and other parts that don't always turn out well on the first try
- Changing hair color
- Adding or removing elements from the image

<Callout type="info">
Don't get discouraged if you don't achieve the desired result on the first try. Inpainting is often an iterative process.
</Callout>

## Describe

After uploading an image to "Custom Image", a "Describe" button becomes available. Clicking it will send the image to a neural network that will try to create an English prompt describing your image. This way, you don't have to write the prompt yourself.

## Usage Examples

- **Stylization** - transforming photos into artistic styles
- **Enhancement** - improving quality and detail
- **Variations** - creating similar images with changes
- **Correction** - fixing defects using the mask
- **Expansion** - adding new elements to an existing image
