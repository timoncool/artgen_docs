# Models

![Model selection](/assets/docs-pages/screens/model-selection-new.webp)

A model is like an operating system. If ArtGeneration.me is a computer, then the model is its operating system. Everything you can generate depends on the model.

## Base Architectures

The platform uses two main architectures:

- **SDXL** — a high-quality architecture for creating detailed images
- **FLUX** — the newest architecture with deep prompt understanding and improved instruction following

Based on these base architectures, the community around the world trains their own *specialized models* for different styles.

## Model Categories

Different models are oriented towards different results. On model cards, you will notice various category labels:

- **PHOTO** — models for photorealistic images
- **ANIME** — models for creating illustrations in Japanese animation style
- **ART** — models for creating various illustrations
- **3D** — models for creating 3D-style characters, like Pixar
- **2.5D** — models that bridge realism and anime aesthetics
- **DESIGN** — models for typography and interiors
- **NSFW** — models for adult content

<Callout type="info">
It's better to generate anime on an anime model and photorealistic images on a photo model. Choose a model according to your desired style.

## Additional Labels

Besides style categories, models may have other labels:

- **HIT** — most popular models
- **NEW** — recently added models
- **SDXL** — model built on SDXL architecture
- **FLUX** — model built on FLUX architecture

## Model Card

Hover over a model card to see the description. The card displays:
- Preview image created with the model
- Model name
- Price per generation in coins
- Labels (HIT, NEW, etc.)

## Model Information

## Status Indicators

The platform rents hundreds of GPUs from multiple providers. Since there are many models, some may be more loaded than others. Status indicators help understand the current load:

- **Green** — model is running stably
- **Yellow** — model is loaded but functional
- **Red** — model is overloaded

<Callout type="info">
A red indicator is not a death sentence. You can try using the model and it might work fine. This is just statistical information for guidance.
