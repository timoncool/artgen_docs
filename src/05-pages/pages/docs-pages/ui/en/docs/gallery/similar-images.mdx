## How Similar Image Selection Works

The ArtGeneration.me system uses several criteria to select relevant works:

**Visual similarity** - algorithms analyze image content: colors, composition, objects. This allows finding visually similar works regardless of the prompts used.

**Semantic similarity** - analysis of prompts and descriptions. Images with similar text prompts are grouped together.

**Model and style** - works created using the same model or style often have similar characteristics.

**Tags and categories** - if images share common tags or belong to the same category, they are more likely to appear in recommendations.

**Author** - sometimes other works by the same author appear in recommendations, especially if they are done in a similar style.

## Navigating Similar Images

**Horizontal scrolling** - the similar images section scrolls horizontally. Use mouse or swipe to view more works.

**Click to view** - click on any similar image to go to its full view.

**Endless exploration** - by moving from one image to another through similar works, you can explore the gallery, finding ever more interesting works.

## How to Use Similar Images

**Finding inspiration** - if you liked a work, similar images will show other interpretations of the same theme or style.

**Learning techniques** - by comparing similar works, you can understand how different prompts, models, and settings affect the result.

**Discovering authors** - through similar images, you can find new talented authors whose works you'll enjoy.
