# Generation Details

![Generation Details](/assets/docs-pages/images/blog/img_028.png)

The image viewing page displays all parameters used during generation. This information helps understand how the image was created and use this knowledge for your own works.

## Prompt

The main text prompt that describes the desired image. The prompt is the "instruction" for the neural network.

**What you can learn from the prompt:**
- What keywords the author used
- How the prompt is structured
- What details were explicitly specified

**Copying the prompt** - click the copy icon next to the prompt to copy it to clipboard. This is convenient for studying and creating your own variations.

## Negative Prompt

Specifies what to avoid in generation. The negative prompt helps exclude unwanted elements and artifacts.

Studying negative prompts from experienced users will help you understand which exclusions are effective for different types of images.

## Model

![Filter panel with categories and models](/assets/docs-pages/screens/image-metadata-panel.png)

The name of the model used for generation. Different models have different strengths:

- Some models are better for photorealism
- Others are optimized for anime or illustrations
- There are models for specific styles and themes

Knowing the model, you can try to create similar works with the same settings.

## Style

If the author used one of ArtGeneration.me's preset styles, it will be indicated here. Styles add specific artistic characteristics to the image.

## Technical Parameters

**Resolution** - image size in pixels (e.g., 1024x1024). Affects detail and proportions.

**Steps** - number of generation iterations. More steps usually means more detailed results.

**CFG Scale** - how strictly the model followed the prompt. Low values give more creative freedom, high values - more precise prompt following.

**Sampler** - generation algorithm. Different samplers give different results even with identical parameters.

**Seed** - initial value of the random number generator. With the same seed and parameters, you can reproduce an identical result.

## LoRA and Additional Models

If LoRA or other additional models were used during generation, they will also be listed with information about influence strength (weight).

## Using Parameters

**"Create version" button** - automatically copies all parameters to the generator, allowing you to create your own variation.

**Copying individual parameters** - each parameter can be copied separately by clicking the corresponding icon.

**Learning and training** - analyzing parameters of successful works is an excellent way to improve your skills in creating prompts and configuring generation.
