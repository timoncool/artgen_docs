Create an initial image in the generator.

### Edit in the editor
Open the image in the editor and make the necessary changes.

### Send back to the generator
Send the edited image back to the generator.

### Add new elements
Add new elements through inpainting.

### Repeat the process
Repeat the process until you achieve the desired result.
</Steps>
