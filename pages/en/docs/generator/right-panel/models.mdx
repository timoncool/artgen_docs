# Models

![Model Selection](/screens/model-selection-overlay.png)

The model (also called checkpoint) is the most important part of the image generation system. There are several types of models:

- **SDXL** — high-quality architecture for creating detailed images
- **Flux** — the newest architecture with deep prompt understanding and improved instruction following
- **RunWare / GE / Custom** — specialized models from various providers
- **Editing models** — models for inpainting, outpainting, face-swap, and stylization

Based on the base models, the global community trains their own *specialized models* for working in different styles.

A model is like an operating system. If ArtGeneration.me is the computer hardware, then the model is its operating system. Everything you can generate depends on the model.

Different models are optimized for different results:
- Anime is better generated on anime models
- Photorealistic images — on photo models

## Available Resolutions

Most modern models support high resolutions:
- **Standard SDXL models**: from 1024×1024 to 1536×1536
- **4K-capable models**: up to 1536×1536 and higher (e.g., 1472×704 for widescreen)
- For even higher quality, use the **upscale x2/x4** feature

## Model Categories

In the filter dialog you can:
- Switch between "Categories" and "Models" tabs
- Select multiple categories at once
- Search models by name
- See brief description and price for each model

## Model Indicators

Since there are many models and only a few service providers running them, some models may be more loaded than others. Therefore, models have three indicators:

- **Green** — Model works stably, fast, and without errors
- **Yellow** — Model is under load, generation time may be longer than usual
- **Red** — Model is overloaded, generation time is high

A red indicator is not a verdict. You can try using the model, and it might work fine. This is just statistical information for guidance.

## Special Editing Models

In addition to image generation models, specialized models are available:

- **Inpainting** — for editing specific areas of an image
- **Outpainting** — for extending an image beyond its borders
- **Face Swap** — for replacing faces in images
- **Stylization** — for applying artistic styles to photos
