# Resolution

![Resolution](/screens/resolution-slider.png)

Resolution defines the size of the generated image in pixels. Choosing the right resolution is important for getting quality results.

## How to Choose Resolution

In ArtGeneration.me, a convenient slider is available for selecting resolution. You can:
- Choose from preset aspect ratios (1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9, 9:16)
- Manually set width and height using sliders
- See the current aspect ratio and size in pixels

## Aspect Ratios

### Square (1:1)
Ideal for:
- Portraits
- Avatars and icons
- Social media images
- Symmetric compositions

### Portrait (vertical)
Ratios **2:3**, **3:4**, **9:16** are suitable for:
- Full-length portraits
- Vertical posters
- Instagram stories
- Book covers

### Landscape (horizontal)
Ratios **3:2**, **4:3**, **16:9** are suitable for:
- Landscapes
- Desktop wallpapers
- Cinematic scenes
- Banners and headers

## Recommended Resolutions

### For SDXL Models
- **1024×1024** — optimal square
- **1152×896** — landscape
- **896×1152** — portrait
- **1216×832** — widescreen
- **832×1216** — tall portrait
- **1536×1536** — maximum for detailed work

### For FLUX Models
- **1024×1024** — base
- **1472×704** — widescreen
- **704×1472** — tall portrait
- Supports resolutions up to 4K and higher

## Impact of Resolution on Results

**Generation time:** Higher resolution means longer generation time.

**Detail quality:** High resolution allows for more details but requires more computational resources.

**Cost:** High resolution generation may cost more coins.

## Upscale as an Alternative

Instead of generating at high resolution, it's recommended to:
1. Generate an image at the optimal resolution for the model (1024×1024)
2. Apply **Upscale x2** or **Upscale x4** for enlargement without quality loss

This approach gives better results, saves time, and coins.

## Tips

- Start with the recommended resolution for your model
- Use lower resolution for testing ideas
- Use Upscale x2/x4 for final works
- Consider the intended use of the image when choosing aspect ratio
- Some models support resolutions up to 1536×1536 and higher — check model information
