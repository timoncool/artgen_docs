# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How do I upload my own image for generation?

Use the "Your Image" function in the right panel of generation settings. You can upload an image from your device and use it as a basis for further generation. Please note that according to the service rules, you can only upload images that you have rights to. Do not use other people's images found on the Internet.

## What is the difference between PRO subscription and free access?

PRO subscription opens a number of additional features:

- Save images in PNG and JPG formats in addition to standard WEBP
- Access to view and generate NSFW content (if enabled in settings)
- Increased limit up to 300 free generations per day (instead of 50 on free plan)
- Access to private mode, ability to hide your generations from other users
- Additional 2 simultaneous requests for image creation (up to 4 images in 3 tabs instead of 1 tab and 2 images on free plan)

## I registered via VK/Yandex, how do I set a password for email login?

Go to the "Settings" section in the user menu. Even if you initially used quick registration via social networks, you will see a form for setting a password for your account.

## How do I disable ads in the service?

To completely remove ads, subscribe to PRO. On the free plan, ads are shown to cover the costs of generation and image storage.

## I ran out of generations, where can I get more?

Every day, each user has 50 free generations available (300 on PRO subscription). To get them, click the "Claim" button at the top of the screen. Generations will be credited to your account.

## How do I change my display name in my profile?

The name is changed in the "Settings" section. You can use any characters, emojis and ASCII art are supported. Be creative!

## How do I get my work on the ArtGeneration.me cover?

The algorithm is simple - share links to your generations in our Telegram community [https://t.me/ArtGenerationMe](https://t.me/ArtGenerationMe) and with friends, ask them to like. Images with the most likes automatically appear on the main page and site covers. Also don't forget to like cool works of other users!

## What is NSFW content and how do I get access to it on ArtGeneration.me?

NSFW stands for "Not Safe For Work". This term refers to content that should not be opened in public places, around children, or at work, as it may contain elements of erotica, violence, or shocking scenes.

On ArtGeneration.me, the NSFW category includes artistic images with nudity and light erotica. According to our rules, NSFW images should not contain pornography, genitalia, or explicit sexual scenes.

Access to generation and viewing of NSFW works is open only to users over 18 years old with an active PRO subscription. To get access, you need to:

1. Subscribe to PRO.
2. Go to profile settings.
3. Check the box next to "I am over 18 and want to see NSFW content".
4. Save changes.

## Is money automatically charged after the gifted subscription expires?

No, the gift subscription does not require payment and does not renew automatically. Payment can only be charged if you independently link a card and subscribe to a paid subscription.

## How do I make a Full HD or 4k image or other specific resolution?

Our service uses Stable Diffusion neural network models that are trained on certain image resolutions. The resolutions available to users provide an optimal balance of quality and generation speed. You can increase the resolution of the generated image using x2 upscale and outpainting functions. By combining these tools, you can get an image up to 4K in size. Final size adjustment can be done in any graphics editor.

## Can I use generated images for commercial purposes?

According to our user agreement, rights to images created using our service belong to users, unless copyrights, related rights, and other rights of third parties are violated. However, text prompts are not subject to copyright. If you want to keep prompts secret, work in private generation mode. When publishing images generated by us, we ask you to indicate a link to the image page on [ArtGeneration.me](https://artgeneration.me) if possible.

## Is private generation available on the free plan?

No, private mode, which allows you to hide your generations from other users, is an exclusive feature available only to PRO subscribers. On the free plan, all images you generate will be displayed in the general feed.

## How do I add text to a generated image?

Adding coherent text is a known limitation of modern neural network models. They still struggle with generating readable letters and words, confusing characters, especially for languages with complex graphics. If you need an inscription, try writing it in UPPER CASE, put it in "quotes", place it closer to the beginning of the request and indicate that it is text, logo or caption. But it will be better to add text on top of the finished image in a graphics editor.

## I can't create what I want, what should I do?

The art of writing quality prompt requests, called "prompt engineering", is a skill that requires some practice. Usually users achieve excellent results after a couple of weeks of regular use of the service. Study examples of other users' works in the gallery, experiment with different formulations. If you need help, contact our Telegram community [https://t.me/ArtGenerationMe](https://t.me/ArtGenerationMe), they will definitely help you.

## How do I cancel my paid subscription?

Go to the "Payments" tab, which is located in the user menu. There you will see information about the current subscription and a button to disable auto-renewal. After canceling auto-payment, the subscription will be active until the end of the paid period.

## What payment methods are available for subscription and generations?

Currently we accept payment from Russian bank cards, through the Fast Payment System (SBP), as well as from YuMoney wallet. If you have difficulties with payment, write to our support service.

## How do I download all my generated images?

In the "Settings" section, find the "Download my images" item, there you can select the time period for which you want to download images, the archive will be generated within an hour and a download link will be sent to your email. The archive link will be available for 72 hours. The function is available on Pro and Max plans.

## Can I organize images into folders and albums?

Currently, all images you create are collected in folders by generation dates. The ability to create personal folders and albums is being worked on and may appear in future updates.

## What should I do if I notice generated images that violate the service rules?

If you see content that violates our rules (contains shock content, excessive violence, pornography, extremism propaganda, etc.), use the "Report" function. Moderators will review your complaint and take necessary action.

## Why can't I register via Google account?

Unfortunately, due to Federal Law No. 406-FZ dated 31.07.2023, we had to disable the ability to register and log in via Google accounts for users from Russia. You can use quick registration via VK, Yandex or Mail.ru.
